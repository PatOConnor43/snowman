# zsh plugin
There's a [spaceship-prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) plugin that I wrote to highlight when I have an environment active. In order to use it, you'll need to include the snowman.zsh file in `$SPACESHIP_ROOT/sections`.

Once that file is there you can add it to your `$SPACESHIP_PROMPT_ORDER` env var or add it as a default in `SPACESHIP_ROOT/spaceship.zsh`. Check out the snowman.zsh file to see the configuration options that are supported. For more spaceship-prompt information refer to their README.

Here's a preview with the default options:
